At each step, the next phoneme is chosen probabilistically based on the transition probabilities of the current phoneme. The corresponding acoustic observations (e.g., energy, pitch, duration) are generated probabilistically based on the emission probabilities.\n",
    "##### ->Generated Sequences: The generated phoneme sequence follows the transition probabilities closely, simulating the structure of the word \"speech.\" The observation sequence provides measurable acoustic features tied to the phonemes.\n",
    "##### -> Expected Output: A sample phoneme sequence could look like: ['/s/', '/p/', '/ie:/', '/tS/']. Corresponding observation sequence might include random values such as ['Energy', 'Pitch', 'Duration', 'Energy'], reflecting the probabilistic nature of the emission process.\n",

    "##### -> The implementation showcases the power of HMM in modeling sequences with hidden states and observations, which is a fundamental concept in speech processing.\n",
    "##### -> By tuning the transition and emission probabilities, the model can simulate different phoneme transitions and acoustic patterns, making it adaptable for various linguistic tasks."
